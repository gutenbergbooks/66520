<p class="poem">
  To the fairest!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to thee<br />
  Consecrate and bounden be,<br />
  Winchester! this verse of mine.<br />
  Ah, that loveliness of thine!<br />
  To have lived enchaunted years<br />
  Free from sorrows, free from fears,<br />
  Where thy Tower's great shadow falls<br />
  Over those proud buttressed walls;<br />
  Whence a purpling glory pours<br />
  From high heaven's inheritors,<br />
  Throned within the arching stone!<br />
  To have wandered, hushed, alone,<br />
  Gently round thy fair, fern-grown<br />
  Chauntry of the Lilies, lying<br />
  Where the soft night winds go sighing<br />
  Round thy Cloisters, in moonlight<br />
  Branching dark, or touched with white:<br />
  Round old, chill aisles, where moon-smitten<br />
  Blanches the <i>Orate</i>, written<br />
  Under each worn, old-world face<br />
  Graven on Death's holy place!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To the noblest!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None but thee.<br />
  Blest our living eyes, that see<br />
  Half a thousand years fulfilled<br />
  Of that age, which Wykeham willed<br />
  Thee to win; yet all unworn,<br />
  As upon that first March morn,<br />
  When thine honoured city saw<br />
  Thy young beauty without flaw,<br />
  Born within her water-flowing,<br />
  Ancient hollows, by wind-blowing<br />
  Hills enfolded ever more.<br />
  Thee, that lord of splendid lore,<br />
  Orient from old Hellas' shore,<br />
  Grocyn, had to mother: thee,<br />
  Monumental majesty<br />
  Of most high philosophy<br />
  Honours, in thy wizard Browne:<br />
  Tender Otway's dear renown,<br />
  Mover of a perfect pity,<br />
  Victim of the iron city,<br />
  Thine to cherish is: and thee,<br />
  Laureate of Liberty;<br />
  Harper of the Highland faith,<br />
  Elf, and faery, and wan wraith;<br />
  Chaunting softly, chaunting slowly,<br />
  Minstrel of all melancholy;<br />
  Master of all melody,<br />
  Made to cling round memory;<br />
  Passion's poet, Evening's voice,<br />
  Collins glorified.  Rejoice,<br />
  Mother! in thy sons: for all<br />
  Love thine immemorial<br />
  Name, august and musical.<br />
  Not least he, who left thy side,<br />
  For his sire's, thine earlier pride,<br />
  Arnold: whom we mourn to-day,<br />
  Prince of song, and gone away<br />
  To his brothers of the bay:<br />
  Thine the love of all his years;<br />
  His be now thy praising tears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  To the dearest!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, to thee!<br />
  Hast thou not in all to me<br />
  Mother, more than mother, been?<br />
  Well toward thee may Mary Queen<br />
  Bend her with a mother's mien;<br />
  Who so rarely dost express<br />
  An inspiring tenderness,<br />
  Woven with thy sterner strain,<br />
  Prelude of the world's true pain.<br />
  But two years, and still my feet<br />
  Found thy very stones more sweet,<br />
  Than the richest fields elsewhere:<br />
  Two years, and thy sacred air<br />
  Still poured balm upon me, when<br />
  Nearer drew the world of men;<br />
  When the passions, one by one,<br />
  All sprang upward to the sun:<br />
  Two years have I lived, still thine;<br />
  Lost, thy presence! gone, that shrine,<br />
  Where six years, what years! were mine.<br />
  Music is the thought of thee;<br />
  Fragrance, all thy memory.<br />
  Those thy rugged Chambers old,<br />
  In their gloom and rudeness, hold<br />
  Dear remembrances of gold.<br />
  Some first blossoming of flowers<br />
  Made delight of all the hours;<br />
  Greatness, beauty, all things fair<br />
  Made the spirit of thine air:<br />
  Old years live with thee; thy sons<br />
  Walk with high companions.<br />
  Then, the natural joy of earth,<br />
  Joy of very health and birth!<br />
  Hills, upon a summer noon:<br />
  Water Meads, on eves of June:<br />
  Chamber Court, beneath the moon:<br />
  Days of spring, on Twyford Down,<br />
  Or when autumn woods grew brown;<br />
  As they looked, when here came Keats,<br />
  Chaunting of autumnal sweets;<br />
  Through this city of old haunts,<br />
  Murmuring immortal chaunts;<br />
  As when Pope, art's earlier king,<br />
  Here, a child, did nought but sing;<br />
  Sang, a child, by nature's rule,<br />
  Round the trees of Twyford School:<br />
  Hours of sun beside Mead's Wall,<br />
  Ere the may begin to fall;<br />
  Watching the rooks rise and soar,<br />
  High from lime and sycamore:<br />
  Wanderings by old-world ways,<br />
  Walks and streets of ancient days;<br />
  Closes, churches, arches, halls,<br />
  Vanished men's memorials.<br />
  There was beauty, there was grace,<br />
  Each place was an holy place:<br />
  There the kindly fates allowed<br />
  Me too room; and made me proud,<br />
  Prouder name I have not wist!<br />
  With the name of Wykehamist.<br />
  These thy joys: and more than these:<br />
  Ah, to watch beneath thy trees,<br />
  Through long twilights linden-scented,<br />
  Sunsets, lingering, lamented,<br />
  In the purple west; prevented,<br />
  Ere they fell, by evening star!<br />
  Ah, long nights of Winter! far<br />
  Leaps and roars the faggot fire;<br />
  Ruddy smoke rolls higher, higher,<br />
  Broken through by flame's desire;<br />
  Circling faces glow, all eyes<br />
  Take the light; deep radiance flies,<br />
  Merrily flushing overhead<br />
  Names of brothers, long since fled;<br />
  And fresh clusters, in their stead,<br />
  Jubilant round fierce forest flame.<br />
  Friendship too must make her claim:<br />
  But what songs, what memories end,<br />
  When they tell of friend on friend?<br />
  And for them, I thank thy name.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Love alone of gifts, no shame<br />
  Lessens, and I love thee: yet<br />
  Sound it but of echoes, let<br />
  This my maiden music be,<br />
  Of the love I bear to thee,<br />
  Witness and interpreter,<br />
  Mother mine: loved Winchester!<br />

  PLATO IN LONDON.<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  <i>To Campbell Dodgson.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The pure flame of one taper fall<br />
  Over the old and comely page:<br />
  No harsher light disturb at all<br />
  This converse with a treasured sage.<br />
  Seemly, and fair, and of the best,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Plato be our guest,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should things befall.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Without, a world of noise and cold:<br />
  Here, the soft burning of the fire.<br />
  And Plato walks, where heavens unfold,<br />
  About the home of his desire.<br />
  From his own city of high things,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shows to us, and brings,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Truth of fine gold.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The hours pass; and the fire burns low;<br />
  The clear flame dwindles into death:<br />
  Shut then the book with care; and so,<br />
  Take leave of Plato, with hushed breath:<br />
  A little, by the falling gleams,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tarry the gracious dreams:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they too go.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lean from the window to the air:<br />
  Hear London's voice upon the night!<br />
  Thou hast bold converse with things rare:<br />
  Look now upon another sight!<br />
  The calm stars, in their living skies:<br />
  And then, these surging cries,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This restless glare!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  That starry music, starry fire,<br />
  High above all our noise and glare:<br />
  The image of our long desire,<br />
  The beauty, and the strength, are there.<br />
  And Plato's thought lives, true and clear,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In as august a sphere:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance, far higher.<br />

  The large, calm harbour lies below<br />
  Long, terraced lines of circling light:<br />

</p>

<p class="poem">
  No sight, no sound, no living stir,<br />

  We glide by many a lanterned mast;<br />

<p class="poem">
  Only one voice could sing aright<br />
  His brother poet, lost in night:<br />
  His voice, who lies not far away,<br />
  The pure and perfect voice of Gray.<br />
  The sleep of humble men he sang,<br />
  For whom the tolling church bells rang<br />
  Over their silent fields and vales,<br />
  Whence no rude sound their calm assails.<br />
  He knew their melancholy rest,<br />
  And peaceful sleep, on earth's kind breast;<br />
  Their patient lives, their common doom,<br />
  The beauty of their simple tomb.<br />
  One thing he left unsung: how some,<br />
  To share those village slumbers, come:<br />
  Whose voices filled the world with joy,<br />
  Who made high thoughts their one employ.<br />
  Ah, loving hearts!  Too great to prize<br />
  Things whereon most men set their eyes:<br />
  The applauding crowd; the golden lure<br />
  Of wealth, insatiate and unsure;<br />
  A life of noise! a restless death:<br />
  The sanctities of life's last breath<br />
  Profaned with ritual pride and state;<br />
  Last pageant of the little great!<br />
  But these, to whom all crowns of song,<br />
  And all immortal praise, belong,<br />
  Turn from each garish sight and sound,<br />
  To lay them down in humble ground:<br />
  Choosing that still, enchaunted sleep<br />
  To be, where kindly natures keep:<br />
  In sound of pleasant water rills,<br />
  In shadows of the solemn hills.<br />
  Earth's heart, earth's hidden way, they knew:<br />
  Now on their grave light falls her dew.<br />
  The music of her soul was theirs:<br />
  They sleep beneath her sweetest airs.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Beside the broad, gray Thames one lies,<br />
  With whom a spring of beauty dies:<br />
  Among the willows, the pure wind<br />
  Calls all his wistful song to mind;<br />
  And, as the calm, strong river flows,<br />
  With it his mightier music goes;<br />
  But those winds cool, those waters lave,<br />
  The country of his chosen grave.<br />
  Go past the cottage flowers, and see,<br />
  Where Arnold held it good to be!<br />
  Half church, half cottage, comely stands<br />
  An holy house, from Norman hands:<br />
  By rustic Time well taught to wear<br />
  Some lowly, meditative air:<br />
  Long ages of a pastoral race<br />
  Have softened sternness into grace;<br />
  And many a touch of simpler use<br />
  From Norman strength hath set it loose.<br />
  Here, under old, red-fruited yews,<br />
  And summer suns, and autumn dews,<br />
  With his lost children at his side,<br />
  Sleeps Arnold: Still those waters glide,<br />
  Those winds blow softly down their breast:<br />
  But he, who loved them, is at rest.<br />

<p class="poem">
  The children of the mingling mists: can they,<br />
  Born by the melancholy hills, love thee,<br />
  Royal and joyous light?  From dawn of day,<br />
  We watch the trailing shadows of the waste,<br />
  The waste moors, or the ever-mourning sea:<br />
  What, though in speedy splendour thou hast raced<br />
  Over the heather or wild wave, a ray<br />
  Of travelling glory and swift bloom?  Still thou<br />
  Inhabitest the mighty morning's brow:<br />
  And hast thy flaming and celestial way,<br />
  Afar from our sad beauties, in thine haste.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Have thou thy circling triumph of the skies,<br />
  Horseman of Goldwhite Footsteps!  Yet all fire<br />
  Lives not with thee: for part is in our eyes,<br />
  Beholding the loved beauty of cold hills:<br />
  And part is patron of dear home desire,<br />
  Flashing upon the central hearth: it fills<br />
  Ingle and black-benched nook with radiances,<br />
  Hearts with responding spirit, ears with deep<br />
  Delicious music of the ruddy leap,<br />
  And streaming strength, and kindling confluences:<br />
  The hearth glows, and the cavernous chimney thrills,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Pale with great heat, panting to crimson gloom,<br />
  Quiver the deeps of the rich fire: see there!<br />
  Was not that your fair face, in burning bloom<br />
  Wrought by the art of fire?  O happy art!<br />
  That sets in living flames a face so fair:<br />
  The face, whose changes dominate mine heart,<br />
  And with a look speak my delight or doom:<br />
  Nay, now not doom, for I am only thine,<br />
  And one in thee and me the fire divine!<br />
  The fire, that wants the whole vast world for room:<br />
  Yet dwells in us contented and apart.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The flames' red dance is done: and we crouch close<br />
  With shadowy faces to the dull, red glow.<br />
  Your darkling loveliness is like the rose,<br />
  Its dusky petals, and its bower of soft<br />
  Sweet inner darkness, where the dew lies low:<br />
  And now one tongue of flame leaps up aloft,<br />
  Brightening your brows: and now it fails, and throws<br />
  A play of flushing shadows, the rich mist<br />
  Of purple grapes, that many a sun hath kissed;<br />
  The delicate darkness, that with autumn grows<br />
  On red ripe apples in a mossy croft.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Nay! leave such idle southern imageries,<br />
  Vineyard and orchard, flowers and mellow fruit:<br />
  Great store is ours of mountain mysteries.<br />
  Look, where the embers fade, from ruddy gold<br />
  Into gray ashes falling without bruit!<br />
  Yet is that ruddy lustre bought and sold,<br />
  Elf with elf trafficking his merchandise:<br />
  Deep at the strong foot of the eagles' pass,<br />
  They store the haunting treasure, and amass<br />
  The spirit of dead fire: there still it lies,<br />
  Phantom wealth, goodlier than Ophir old.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Across the moor, over the purple bells,<br />
  Over the heather blossom, the rain drives:<br />
  Art fired enough to dare the blowing fells,<br />
  And ford the brawling brooks?  Ah, come we then!<br />
  Great good it is to see, how beauty thrives<br />
  For desolate moorland and for moorland men;<br />
  To smell scents, rarer than soft honey cells,<br />
  From bruised wild thyme, pine bark, or mouldering peat;<br />
  To watch the crawling gray clouds drift, and meet<br />
  Midway the ragged cliffs.  O mountain spells,<br />
  Calling us forth, by hill, and moor, and glen!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Calling us forth, to be with earth again,<br />
  Her memories, her splendours, her desires!<br />
  The fires of the hearth are fallen: now the rain<br />
  Stirs its delight of waters, as the flame<br />
  Stirred its delight of heat and spirited fires.<br />
  Come! by the lintel listen: clouds proclaim,<br />
  That thunder is their vast voice: the winds wane,<br />
  That all the storm may gather strength, and strive<br />
  Once more in their great breath to be alive;<br />
  And fill the angry air with such a strain,<br />
  As filled the world's war, when the world first came.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Desolate Cornwall, desolate Brittany,<br />
  Are up in vehement wind and vehement wave:<br />
  Ancient delights are on their ancient sea,<br />
  And nature's violent graces waken there;<br />
  And there goes loveliness about the grave,<br />
  And death means dreaming, not life's long despair.<br />
  Our sister lands are they, one people we,<br />
  Cornwall desolate, Brittany desolate,<br />
  And Wales: to us is granted to be great:<br />
  Because, as winds and seas and flames are free,<br />
  We too have freedom full, as wild and rare.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And therefore, on a night of heavenly fires;<br />
  And therefore, on a windy hour of noon;<br />
  Our soul, like nature's eager soul, aspires,<br />
  Finding all thunders and all winds our friends:<br />
  And like the moving sea, love we the moon;<br />
  And life in us the way of nature wends,<br />
  Ardent as nature's own, that never tires.<br />
  Born of wild land, children of mountains, we<br />
  Fear neither ruining earth, nor stormy sea:<br />
  Even as men told in Athens, of our sires:<br />
  And as it shall be, till the old world ends.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Your eyes but brighten to the streaming wind,<br />
  But lighten to the sighing air, but break<br />
  To tears before the labouring hills: your mind<br />
  Moves with the passionate spirit of the land.<br />
  Now crystal is your soul, now flame: a lake,<br />
  Proud and calm, with high scaurs on either hand;<br />
  Or a swift lance of lightning, to strike blind.<br />
  True child of Gwynedd, child of wilds and fields!<br />
  To you earth clings, to you strange nature yields<br />
  Far learning, sudden light, fierce fire: these find<br />
  Home in your heart, and thoughts that understand.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We will not wander from this land; we will<br />
  Be wise together, and accept our world:<br />
  This world of the gray cottage by the hill,<br />
  This gorge, this lusty air, this loneliness:<br />
  The calm of drifting clouds; the pine-tops whirled<br />
  And swayed along the ridges.  Here distress<br />
  Dreams, and delight dreams: dreaming, we can fill<br />
  All solitary haunts with prophecy,<br />
  All heights with holiness and mystery;<br />
  Our hearts with understanding, and our will<br />
  With love of nature's law and loveliness.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Old voices call, old pleasures lure: for now<br />
  The wet earth breathes ancient fair fragrance forth;<br />
  And dying gales hang in the branches, blow<br />
  And fall, and blow again: our widest home<br />
  Is with rich winds of West, loud winds of North,<br />
  Sweeping beneath a gray and vasty dome.<br />
  Not with the hearth, whose consolations go,<br />
  Our home of homes: but where our eyes grown tired<br />
  Of straitened joys, with stretching joys are fired:<br />
  Joys of the rolling moor and cloudy brow,<br />
  Or worn, precipitous bastions of the foam.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Our fires are fallen from their blossoming height,<br />
  And linger in sad embers: but gray bloom<br />
  Is on the heather, an enchaunting light<br />
  Of purple dusk and vesper air: rich rain<br />
  Falls on our hearts, through eve and gentle gloom,<br />
  More than upon our foreheads.  The world's pain<br />
  And joy of storm are proven our delight,<br />
  And peace enthroned for ever: ours the mirth,<br />
  And melancholy of this ancient earth:<br />
  Ours are the mild airs and the starred twilight;<br />
  And we, who love them, are not all in vain.<br />

  A CORNISH NIGHT.<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  <i>To William Butler Yeats.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Merry the night, you riders of the wild!<br />
  A merry night to ride your wilderness.<br />
  Come you from visionary haunts, enisled<br />
  Amid the northern waters pitiless,<br />
  Over these cliffs white-heathered?  Upon mild<br />
  Midnights of dewy June, oh, rare to press<br />
  Past moonlit fields of white bean-flowers! nor less<br />
  To wander beside falling waves, beguiled<br />
  By soft winds into still dreams!  Yet confess,<br />
  You chivalries of air, unreconciled<br />
  To the warm, breathing world! what ghostly stress<br />
  Compels your visit unto sorrow's child?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What would you here?  For here you have no part:<br />
  Only the sad voices of wind and sea<br />
  Are prophets here to any wistful heart:<br />
  Or white flowers found upon a glimmering lea.<br />
  What would you here?  Sweep onward, and depart<br />
  Over the ocean into Brittany,<br />
  Where old faith is, and older mystery!<br />
  Though this be western land, we have no art<br />
  To welcome spirits in community:<br />
  Trafficking, in an high celestial mart,<br />
  Slumber for wondrous knowledge: setting free<br />
  Our souls, that strain and agonize and start.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The wind hath cried to me, all the long day,<br />
  That you were coming, chivalries of air!<br />
  Between the waters and the starry way.<br />
  Fair lies the sea about a land, as fair:<br />
  Moonlight and west winds move upon the bay<br />
  Gently: now down the rough path sweet it were<br />
  To clamber, and so launching out to fare<br />
  Forth for the heart of sea and night, away<br />
  From hard earth's loud uproar, and harder care!<br />
  But you at will about the winds can stray:<br />
  Or bid the wandering stars of midnight bear<br />
  You company: or with the seven stay.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And yet you came for me!  So the wind cried,<br />
  So my soul knows: else why am I awake<br />
  With expectation and desire, beside<br />
  The soothed sea's murmuring nocturnal lake?<br />
  Not sleep, but storm, welcomes a widowed bride:<br />
  Storms of sad certainty, vain want, that make<br />
  Vigil perpetual mine; so that I take<br />
  The gusty night in place of him, who died,<br />
  To clasp me home to heart.  That cannot break,<br />
  The eternal heart of nature far and wide!<br />
  So now, your message! while the clear stars shake<br />
  Within the gleaming sea, shake and abide.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So now, your message!  Breathe words from the wave,<br />
  Or breathe words from the field, into mine ears:<br />
  Or from the sleeping shades of a cold grave<br />
  Bring comfortable solace for my tears.<br />
  Something of my love's heart could nature save:<br />
  Some rich delight to spice the tasteless years,<br />
  Some hope to light the valley of lone fears.<br />
  Hear!  I am left alone, to bear and brave<br />
  The sounding storms: but you, from starry spheres,<br />
  From wild wood haunts, give me, as love once gave<br />
  Joy from his home celestial, so, love's peers!<br />
  Give peace awhile to me, sorrow's poor slave!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In sorrow's order I dwell passionist,<br />
  Cloistered by tossing sea on weary land.<br />
  O vain love! vain, to claim me votarist:<br />
  O vain my heart! that will not understand,<br />
  <i>He is dead!  I am lonely!</i>  Love in a Mist<br />
  My flower is: and salt tangle of the strand,<br />
  The crownals woven by this failing hand:<br />
  In the dark kingdom, walking where I list,<br />
  I walk where Lethe glides against the sand.<br />
  But vain love is a constant lutanist,<br />
  Playing old airs, and able to withstand<br />
  Sweet sleep: vain love, thou loyal melodist!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  You wanderers!  Would I were wandering<br />
  Under the white moon with you, or among<br />
  The invisible stars with you!  Would I might sing<br />
  Over the charmed sea your enchaunting song,<br />
  Song of old autumn, and of radiant spring:<br />
  Might sing, how earth the mother suffers long;<br />
  How the great winds are wild, yet do no wrong;<br />
  How the most frail bloom is at heart a king!<br />
  I could endure then, strenuous and strong:<br />
  But now, O spirits of the air!  I bring<br />
  Before you my waste soul: why will you throng<br />
  About me, save to take even such a thing?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Only for this you ride the midnight gloom,<br />
  Above the ancient isles of the old main.<br />
  The spray leaps on the hidden rocks of doom:<br />
  The ripples break, and wail away again<br />
  Upon the gathering wave: gaunt headlands loom<br />
  In the lone distance of the heaving plain.<br />
  And now, until the calm, the still stars wane,<br />
  You wait upon my heart, my heart a tomb.<br />
  Though I dream, life and dreams are alike vain!<br />
  Then love me, tell me news of dear death: whom<br />
  Circle you, but a soul astray, one fain<br />
  To leave this close world for death's larger room?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If barren be the promise I desire,<br />
  The promise that I shall not always go<br />
  In living solitariness: break fire<br />
  Out of the night, and lay me swiftly low!<br />
  Soft spirits! you have wings to waft me higher,<br />
  Than touch of each my most familiar woe:<br />
  Am I unworthy, you should raise me so?<br />
  If barren be that trust, my dreams inspire<br />
  Only despair; my brooding heart must grow<br />
  Heavy with miseries; a mourning quire,<br />
  To tell the heavy hours, how sad, how slow,<br />
  Are all their footsteps, of whose sound I tire.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Bright seafire runs about a plunging keel<br />
  On vehement nights: and where black danger lies,<br />
  Gleam the torn breakers.  But all days reveal<br />
  Drear dooms for me, nor any nights disguise<br />
  Their menace: never rolls the thunder peal<br />
  Through my worn watch, nor lightning past mine eyes<br />
  Leaps from the blue gloom of its mother skies,<br />
  One hour alone, but all, while sad stars wheel.<br />
  This hour, was it a lie, that bade me rise;<br />
  Some laughing dream, that whispered me to steal<br />
  Into the sea-sweet night, where the wind cries,<br />
  And find the comfort, that I cannot feel?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  My lord hath gone your way perpetual:<br />
  Whether you be great spirits of the dead,<br />
  Or spirits you, that never were in thrall<br />
  To perishing bodies, dust-born, dustward led.<br />
  Sweet shadows! passing by this ocean wall,<br />
  Tarry to pour some balm upon mine head,<br />
  Some pity for a woman, who hath wed<br />
  With weariness and loneliness, from fall<br />
  To fall, from bitter snows to maybloom red:<br />
  The hayfields hear, the cornlands hear, my call!<br />
  From weariness toward weariness I tread;<br />
  And hunger for the end: the end of all.<br />

  LINES TO A LADY UPON HER THIRD BIRTHDAY.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Dear Cousin: to be three years old,<br />
  Is to have found the Age of Gold:<br />
  That Age foregone! that Age foretold!<br />
  What wondrous names, then, wait thy choice,<br />
  High sounding for thine helpless voice!<br />
  I choose instead: and hail in thee<br />
  A queen of lilied Arcady,<br />
  Or lady of Hesperides:<br />
  Or, if Utopia lie near these,<br />
  Utopian thou, by right divine,<br />
  On whom all stars of favour shine.<br />
  Vainly the cold Lycean sage<br />
  Withheld his praise from childhood's age;<br />
  Denied thine happiness to thee;<br />
  Nor as a little child would be!<br />
  Man to the world he could present,<br />
  Magnanimous, magnificent:<br />
  Children, he knew not: for of thee<br />
  Dreamed not his calm philosophy;<br />
  Or Pythias was no Dorothy!<br />
  Thou hast good right to laugh in scorn<br />
  At us, of simple dreams forlorn:<br />
  At us, whose disenchaunted eyes<br />
  Imagination dare despise.<br />
  Thou hast that freshness, early born,<br />
  Which roses have; or billowy corn,<br />
  Waving, and washed in dews of morn:<br />
  And yet, no flower of woodlands wild,<br />
  But overwhelming London's child!<br />
  About thy sleep are heard the feet<br />
  And turmoil of the sounding street:<br />
  Thou hearest not!  The land of dreams<br />
  More closely lies, and clearlier gleams.<br />
  Thou watchest, with thy grave eyes gray,<br />
  Our world, with looks of far away:<br />
  Eyes, that consent to look on things<br />
  Unlike their own imaginings;<br />
  And, looking, weave round all, they see,<br />
  Charms of their own sweet sorcery.<br />
  Thus very London thou dost change<br />
  To wonderland, all fair and strange:<br />
  The ugliness and uproar seem<br />
  To soften, at a child's pure dream:<br />
  And each poor dusty garden yields<br />
  The fresh delight of cowslip fields.<br />
  What is the secret, and the spell?<br />
  Thou knowest: for thou hast it well.<br />
  Wilt thou not pity us, and break<br />
  Thy silent dreaming, for our sake?<br />
  Wilt thou not teach us, how to make<br />
  Worlds of delight from things of nought,<br />
  Or fetched from faery land, and wrought<br />
  With flowers and lovely imageries?<br />
  Pity us! for such wisdom dies:<br />
  Pity thyself! youth flies, youth flies.<br />
  Thou comest to the desert plain,<br />
  Where no dreams follow in thy train:<br />
  They leave thee at the pleasaunce close;<br />
  Lonely the haggard pathway goes.<br />
  Thou wilt look back, and see them, deep<br />
  In the fair glades, where thou didst keep<br />
  Thy summer court, thy summer sleep:<br />
  But thou wilt never see them more,<br />
  Till death the golden dreams restore.<br />
  Now, ere the hard, dull hours begin<br />
  Their sad, destroying work within<br />
  Thy childhood's delicate memory,<br />
  Wilt thou not tell us, Dorothy?<br />
  Nay! thou art in conspiracy<br />
  With all those faeries, children styled,<br />
  To keep the secret of the child.<br />
  Ah! to be only three years old!<br />
  That is indeed an Age of Gold:<br />
  And, care not for mine idle fears!<br />
  Thou need'st not lose it: the far years,<br />
  Touching with love and gentle tears<br />
  The treasures of thy memory,<br />
  May mould them into poetry.<br />
  Then, of those deep eyes, gray and grave,<br />
  The world will be a willing slave:<br />
  Then, all the dreams of dear dreamland<br />
  Wait with their music at thine hand,<br />
  And beauty come at thy command.<br />
  But now, what counts the will of time?<br />
  Enough, thou livest!  And this rhyme,<br />
  Unworthy of the Golden Age,<br />
  Yet hails thee, in that heritage,<br />
  Happy and fair: then, come what may,<br />
  Thou hast the firstfruits of the day.<br />
  Fair fall each morn to thee!  And I,<br />
  Despite all dark fates, Dorothy!<br />
  Will prove me thine affectionate<br />
  Cousin, and loyal Laureate.<br />

  Croagh Patrick is the place of prayers,<br />

  From Dursey Isle to Donegal,<br />

<p class="poem">
  A dream! a dream! an ancient dream!<br />

  THE COMING OF WAR.<br />

<p class="t3">
  <i>To John Davidson.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Gather the people, for the battle breaks:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From camping grounds above the valley,<br />
  Gather the men-at-arms, and bid them rally:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the morn, the battle, wakes.<br />
  High throned above the mountains and the main,<br />
  Triumphs the sun: far down, the pasture plain<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To trampling armour shakes.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  This was the meaning of those plenteous years,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those unarmed years of peace unbroken:<br />
  Flashing war crowns them!  Now war's trump hath spoken<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This final glory in our ears.<br />
  The old blood of our pastoral fathers now<br />
  Riots about our heart, and through our brow:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their sons can have no fears.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  This was our whispering and haunting dream,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cornfields flourished, red and golden:<br />
  When vines hung purple, nor could be withholden<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The radiant outburst of their stream.<br />
  Earth cried to us, that all her laboured store<br />
  Was ours: that she had more to give, and more:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For nothing, did we deem?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We give her back the glory of this hour.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O sun and earth!  O strength and beauty!<br />
  We use you now, we thank you now: our duty<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We stand to do, mailed in your power.<br />
  A little people of a favoured land,<br />
  Helmed with the blessing of the morn we stand:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our life is at its flower.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Gather the people, let the battle break:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hundred peaceful years are over.<br />
  Now march each man to battle, as a lover:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, whom death shall overtake!<br />
  Sleeping upon this field, about his gloom<br />
  Voices shall pierce, to thrill his sacred tomb,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of pride for his great sake.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With melody about us: heart and feet<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responding to one mighty measure;<br />
  Glad with the splendour of an holy pleasure;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swayed, one and all, as wind sways wheat:<br />
  Answering the sunlight with our eyes aglow;<br />
  Serene, and proud, and passionate, we go<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through airs of morning sweet.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Let no man dare to be disheartened now!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We challenge death beyond denial.<br />
  Against the host of death we make our trial:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lord God of Hosts! do thou,<br />
  Who gavest us the fulness of thy sun<br />
  On fields of peace, perfect war's work begun:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warriors, to thee we bow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  O life-blood of remembrance!  Long ago<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land upheld our ancient fathers:<br />
  And for this land, their land, our land, now gathers<br />
  One fellowship against the foe.<br />
  The spears flash: be they as our mothers' eyes!<br />
  The trump sounds: hearken to our fathers' cries!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March we to battle so.<br />

  Calmly, breathe calmly all your music, maids!<br />

  All your lives long, you have nor heard, nor seen,<br />
  Fairer than she, whose hair in sombre braids<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With beauty overshades<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her brow, broad and serene.<br />

  A DREAM OF YOUTH.<br />
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  <i>To Lord Alfred Douglas.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  With faces bright, as ruddy corn,<br />
  Touched by the sunlight of the morn;<br />
  With rippling hair; and gleaming eyes,<br />
  Wherein a sea of passion lies;<br />
  Hair waving back, and eyes that gleam<br />
  With deep delight of dream on dream;<br />
  With full lips, curving into song;<br />
  With shapely limbs, upright and strong:<br />
  The youths on holy service throng.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Vested in white, upon their brows<br />
  Are wreaths fresh twined from dewy boughs<br />
  And flowers they strow along the way,<br />
  Still dewy from the birth of day.<br />
  So, to each reverend altar come,<br />
  They stand in adoration: some<br />
  Swing up gold censers; till the air<br />
  Is blue and sweet, with smoke of rare<br />
  Spices, that fetched from Egypt were.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In voices of calm, choral tone,<br />
  Praise they each God, with praise his own:<br />
  As children of the Gods, is seen<br />
  Their glad solemnity of mien:<br />
  So fair a spirit of the skies<br />
  Is in their going: and their eyes<br />
  Look out upon the peopled earth,<br />
  As theirs were some diviner birth:<br />
  And clear and courtly is their mirth.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Lights of the labouring world, they seem:<br />
  Or, to the tired, like some fresh stream.<br />
  Their dignity of perfect youth<br />
  Compels devotion, as doth truth:<br />
  So right seems all, they do, they are.<br />
  Old age looks wistful, from afar,<br />
  To watch their beauty, as they go,<br />
  Radiant and free, in ordered row;<br />
  And fairer, in the watching, grow.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Fair though it be, to watch unclose<br />
  The nestling glories of a rose,<br />
  Depth on rich depth, soft fold on fold:<br />
  Though fairer be it, to behold<br />
  Stately and sceptral lilies break<br />
  To beauty, and to sweetness wake:<br />
  Yet fairer still, to see and sing,<br />
  One fair thing is, one matchless thing:<br />
  Youth, in its perfect blossoming.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The magic of a golden grace<br />
  Brings fire and sweetness on each face:<br />
  Till, from their passage, every heart<br />
  Takes fire, and sweetness in the smart:<br />
  Till virtue lives, for all who own<br />
  Their majesty, in them alone:<br />
  Till careless hearts, and idle, take<br />
  Delight in living, for their sake;<br />
  Worship their footsteps, and awake.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Beside the tremulous, blue sea,<br />
  Clear at sunset, they love to be:<br />
  And they are rarely sad, but then.<br />
  For sorrow touches them, as men,<br />
  Looking upon the calm of things,<br />
  That pass, and wake rememberings<br />
  Of holy and of ancient awe;<br />
  The charm of immemorial Law:<br />
  <i>What we see now, the great dead saw!</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Upon a morn of storm, a swan,<br />
  Breasting the cold stream, cold and wan,<br />
  Throws back his neck in snowy length<br />
  Between his snowy wings of strength:<br />
  Against him the swift river flows,<br />
  The proudlier he against it goes,<br />
  King of the waters!  For his pride<br />
  Bears him upon a mightier tide:<br />
  May death not be by youth defied?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But the red sun is gone: and gleams<br />
  Of delicate moonlight waken dreams,<br />
  Dreams, and the mysteries of peace:<br />
  Shall this fair darkness ever cease?<br />
  Here is no drear, no fearful Power,<br />
  But life grows fuller with each hour,<br />
  Full of the silence, that is best:<br />
  Earth lies, with soothed and quiet breast,<br />
  Beneath the guardian stars, at rest.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At night, behold them!  Where lights burn<br />
  By moonlit olives, see them turn<br />
  Full faces toward the sailing moon,<br />
  Nigh lovelier than beneath high noon!<br />
  Throw back their comely moulded throats,<br />
  Whence music on the night wind floats!<br />
  And through the fragrant hush of night<br />
  Their lustrous eyes make darkness bright:<br />
  Their laugh loads darkness with delight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Almost the murmuring sea is still:<br />
  Almost the world obeys their will.<br />
  Such youth moves pity in stern Fates,<br />
  And sure death wellnigh dominates:<br />
  Their passion kindles such fair flame,<br />
  As from divine Achilles came:<br />
  A vehement ardour thrills their breasts,<br />
  And beauty's benediction rests<br />
  On earth, and on earth's goodliest guests.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The music of their sighing parts<br />
  A silence: and their beating hearts<br />
  Beat to a measure of despair:<br />
  Ah! how the fire of youth is fair?<br />
  Yet may not be for ever young!<br />
  But night hath yielded; there hath sprung<br />
  Morning upon the throne of night:<br />
  Day comes, with solemnizing light:<br />
  Consuming sorrows take to flight.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Magnificent in early bloom,<br />
  Like Gods, they triumph over gloom:<br />
  All things desirable are theirs,<br />
  Of beauty and of wonder, heirs:<br />
  Their cities, vassals are, which give<br />
  Them thanks and praise, because they live:<br />
  Strong, they are victors of dismay;<br />
  Fair, they serve beauty every day;<br />
  Young, the sun loves to light their way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Where now is death?  Where that gray land?<br />
  Those fearless eyes, those white brows grand,<br />
  That take full sunlight and sweet air<br />
  With rapture true and debonair,<br />
  These have not known the touch of death!<br />
  The world hath winds: these forms have breath,<br />
  But, should death come, should dear life set,<br />
  Calm would each go: <i>Farewell! forget<br />
  Me dead: live you serenely yet.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  See them!  The springing of the palm<br />
  Is nought, beside their gracious calm:<br />
  The rippling of cool waters dies<br />
  To nought, before their clear replies:<br />
  The smile, that heralds their bright thought,<br />
  Brings down the splendid sun to nought.<br />
  See them!  They walk the earth in state:<br />
  In right of perfect youth, held great:<br />
  On whom the powers of nature wait.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No sceptre theirs, but they are kings:<br />
  Their forms and words are royal things.<br />
  Their simple friendship is a court,<br />
  Whither the wise and great resort.<br />
  No homage of the world, they claim:<br />
  But in all places lives their fame.<br />
  Sun, moon, and stars; the earth, the sea;<br />
  Yea! all things, that of beauty be,<br />
  Honour their true divinity.<br />

  Let your swords flash, and wound the golden air of God:<br />
  Bright steel, to meet and cleave the splendour of His sun!<br />
  Now is a war of wars in majesty begun:<br />
  Red shall the cornfields ripen, where our horses trod,<br />
  Where scythe nor sickle swept, but smote war's iron rod:<br />
  Where the stars rose and set, and saw the blood still run.<br />
  So shall men tell of us, and dread our deeds, though done:<br />
  New annals yet shall praise time's fiercest period.<br />

  About the august and ancient <i>Square</i>,<br />

  The blue night air, blows keen and chill:<br />
  Else, all the night sleeps, all is still.<br />
  Now, the lone <i>Square</i> is blind with gloom:<br />
  Now, on that clustering chestnut bloom,<br />
  A cloudy moonlight plays, and falls<br />
  In glory upon <i>Bodley's</i> walls:<br />
  Now, wildlier yet, while moonlight pales,<br />
  Storm the tumultuary gales.<br />
  O rare divinity of Night!<br />
  Season of undisturbed delight:<br />
  Glad interspace of day and day!<br />
  Without, an world of winds at play:<br />
  Within, I hear what dead friends say.<br />
  Blow, winds! and round that perfect <i>Dome</i>,<br />
  Wail as you will, and sweep, and roam:<br />
  Above <i>Saint Mary's</i> carven home,<br />
  Struggle, and smite to your desire<br />
  The sainted watchers on her spire:<br />
  Or in the distance vex your power<br />
  Upon mine own <i>New College</i> tower:<br />
  You hurt not these!  On me and mine,<br />
  Clear candlelights in quiet shine:<br />

  <i>Sterne</i>, exquisite, equivocal;<br />
  <i>Goldsmith</i>, the dearest of them all:<br />
  While <i>Addison's</i> demure delights<br />
  Turn <i>Oxford</i>, into <i>Attic</i>, nights.<br />
  Still <i>Trim</i> and <i>Parson Adams</i> keep<br />
  Me better company, than sleep:<br />
  Dark sleep, who loves not me; nor I<br />
  Love well her nightly death to die,<br />
  And in her haunted chapels lie.<br />
  Sleep wins me not: but from his shelf<br />
  Brings me each wit his very self:<br />
  Beside my chair the great ghosts throng,<br />
  Each tells his story, sings his song:<br />
  And in the ruddy fire I trace<br />
  The curves of each <i>Augustan</i> face.<br />
  I sit at <i>Doctor Primrose'</i> board:<br />
  I hear <i>Beau Tibbs</i> discuss a lord.<br />
  Mine, <i>Matthew Bramble's</i> pleasant wrath;<br />
  Mine, all the humours of the <i>Bath</i>.<br />
  <i>Sir Roger</i> and the <i>Man in Black</i><br />
  Bring me the <i>Golden Ages</i> back.<br />
  Now white <i>Clarissa</i> meets her fate,<br />
  With virgin will inviolate:<br />
  Now <i>Lovelace</i> wins me with a smile,<br />
  <i>Lovelace</i>, adorable and vile.<br />
  I taste, in slow alternate way,<br />
  Letters of <i>Lamb</i>, letters of <i>Gray</i>:<br />
  Nor lives there, beneath <i>Oxford</i> towers,<br />
  More joy, than in my silent hours.<br />
  Dream, who love dreams! forget all grief:<br />
  Find, in sleep's nothingness, relief:<br />
  Better my dreams!  Dear, human books,<br />
  With kindly voices, winning looks!<br />
  Enchaunt me with your spells of art,<br />
  And draw me homeward to your heart:<br />
  Till weariness and things unkind<br />
  Seem but a vain and passing wind:<br />
  Till the gray morning slowly creep<br />
  Upward, and rouse the birds from sleep:<br />
  Till <i>Oxford</i> bells the silence break,<br />
  And find me happier, for your sake.<br />
  Then, with the dawn of common day,<br />
  Rest you!  But I, upon my way,<br />
  What the fates bring, will cheerlier do,<br />
  In days not yours, through thoughts of you!<br />

<p class="poem">
  Far from the world, far from delight,<br />
  Distinguishing not day from night;<br />
  Vowed to one sacrifice of all<br />
  The happy things, that men befall;<br />
  Pleading one sacrifice, before<br />
  Whom sun and sea and wind adore;<br />
  Far from earth's comfort, far away,<br />
  We cry to God, we cry and pray<br />
  For men, who have the common day.<br />
  Dance, merry world! and sing: but we,<br />
  Hearing, remember Calvary:<br />
  Get gold, and thrive you! but the sun<br />
  Once paled; and the centurion<br />
  Said: <i>This dead man was God's own Son</i>.<br />
  Think you, we shrink from common toil,<br />
  Works of the mart, works of the soil;<br />
  That, prisoners of strong despair,<br />
  We breathe this melancholy air;<br />
  Forgetting the dear calls of race,<br />
  And bonds of house, and ties of place;<br />
  That, cowards, from the field we turn,<br />
  And heavenward, in our weakness, yearn?<br />
  Unjust! unkind! while you despise<br />
  Our lonely years, our mournful cries:<br />
  You are the happier for our prayer;<br />
  The guerdon of our souls, you share.<br />
  Not in such feebleness of heart,<br />
  We play our solitary part;<br />
  Not fugitives of battle, we<br />
  Hide from the world, and let things be:<br />
  But rather, looking over earth,<br />
  Between the bounds of death and birth;<br />
  And sad at heart, for sorrow and sin,<br />
  We wondered, where might help begin.<br />
  And on our wonder came God's choice,<br />
  A sudden light, a clarion voice,<br />
  Clearing the dark, and sounding clear:<br />
  And we obeyed: behold us, here!<br />
  In prison bound, but with your chains:<br />
  Sufferers, but of alien pains.<br />
  Merry the world, and thrives apace,<br />
  Each in his customary place:<br />
  Sailors upon the carrying sea,<br />
  Shepherds upon the pasture lea,<br />
  And merchants of the town; and they,<br />
  Who march to death, the fighting way;<br />
  And there are lovers in the spring,<br />
  With those, who dance, and those, who sing:<br />
  The commonwealth of every day.<br />
  Eastward and westward, far away.<br />
  Once the sun paled; once cried aloud<br />
  The Roman, from beneath the cloud:<br />
  <i>This day the Son of God is dead!</i><br />
  Yet heed men, what the Roman said?<br />
  They heed not: we then heed for them,<br />
  The mindless of Jerusalem;<br />
  Careless, they live and die: but we<br />
  Care, in their stead, for Calvary.<br />
  O joyous men and women! strong,<br />
  To urge the wheel of life along,<br />
  With strenuous arm, and cheerful strain,<br />
  And wisdom of laborious brain:<br />
  We give our life, our heart, our breath,<br />
  That you may live to conquer death;<br />
  That, past your tomb, with souls in health,<br />
  Joy may be yours, and blessed wealth;<br />
  Through vigils of the painful night,<br />
  Our spirits with your tempters fight:<br />
  For you, for you, we live alone,<br />
  Where no joy comes, where cold winds moan:<br />
  Nor friends have we, nor have we foes;<br />
  Our Queen is of the lonely Snows.<br />
  Ah! and sometimes, our prayers between,<br />
  Come sudden thoughts of what hath been:<br />
  Dreams!  And from dreams, once more we fall<br />
  To prayer: <i>God save, Christ keep, them all.</i><br />
  And thou, who knowest not these things,<br />
  Hearken, what news our message brings!<br />
  Our toils, thy joy of life forgot:<br />
  Our lives of prayer forget thee not.<br />

  HARVEST.<br />

<p class="t3">
  <i>To Nowell Smith.</i><br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Not now the rejoicing face of summer glows<br />
  In splendour to a blue and splendid sky:<br />
  For now hath died each lingering wild rose<br />
  Off tangled river banks: and autumn shows<br />
  Fields of red corn, that on the downside lie<br />
  Beneath a gentle mist, a golden haze.<br />
  So shrouded, the red cornlands take an air<br />
  Trembling with warm wind: sickle-girt, forth fare<br />
  Harvesting hinds, with swift arms brown and bare;<br />
  Revering well toil's venerable ways.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Most golden music is among the corn,<br />
  Played by the winds wavering over it:<br />
  A murmuring sound, as when against the morn,<br />
  Orient upon calm seas, their noise is borne<br />
  Innumerably rippling and sunlit.<br />
  Most golden music is in either tide:<br />
  And this of radiant corn, before it fall,<br />
  Wills not that summer die unmusical,<br />
  By no rich surge of murmurs glorified:<br />
  Nay! the fields rock and rustle, sounding all<br />
  Praise of the fruitful earth on every side.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Good, through the yellow fields to ponder long:<br />
  Good, long to meditate the stilly sight.<br />
  Afar shone down a brazen sunlight strong,<br />
  Over the harvested hillside, along<br />
  The laboured meadows, burning with great light:<br />
  The air trembled with overflow of heat<br />
  In the low valley, where no movement was<br />
  Of soft-blown wind, ruffling the scytheless grass<br />
  Thick-growing by the waters, cool and sweet:<br />
  No swing of boughs; there were no airs to pass<br />
  Caressing them: all winds failed, when all wheat,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  All fair crops murmuring their soft acclaim,<br />
  Fell, golden rank on golden rank, and lay<br />
  Ruddily heaped along the earth: the flame<br />
  Of delicate poppies, rich and frail, became<br />
  Wan dying weed; convolvulus, astray<br />
  Out from its hedgerows far into the field,<br />
  In clinging coils of leaf and tender bloom,<br />
  Shared with the stalks it clung and clasped, their doom.<br />
  So went the work: so gave the ripened weald<br />
  Its fruits and pleasant flowers; and made a room,<br />
  Wherein fresh winds might wave a fresh year's yield.<br />

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        &bull; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
